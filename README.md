# Welcome!

Hello, I'm Ezequiel, a senior MLOps with a passion for scaling machine learning
solutions to solve big problems. I have been programming with Python since I was
just 16, and I've been hooked ever since. Programming is not just my profession,
but also a hobby that I thoroughly enjoy. I love taking on new challenges and
exploring innovative technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible in
ML.

My programming journey began with traditional software development, building
command-line interfaces and full-stack web applications. However, as I dived
deeper into the world of data science, I found my true calling in machine
learning. I enjoy nothing more than taking a complex data problem and devising a
scalable solution that can make a real-world impact.

In addition to my work in ML, I'm also a Bayesian statistics enthusiast. I
believe that statistical methods can help us better understand the world and
make more informed decisions. That's why I've spent considerable time studying
and applying Bayesian statistics to various domains, with a focus on
incorporating prior knowledge into ML models.

When I'm not working on ML projects, you can find me writing on my [personal
blog](https://elc.github.io) about programming, data science, and other
tech-related topics. I'm also a passionate Christian and an active member of my
church community. I love exploring the intersection of my faith and my love for
statistics and data science.
