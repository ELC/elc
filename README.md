# Welcome!

Hello, I'm Ezequiel, a senior MLOps with a passion for scaling machine learning solutions to solve big problems. I have been programming with Python since I was just 16, and I've been hooked ever since. Programming is not just my profession, but also a hobby that I thoroughly enjoy. I love taking on new challenges and exploring innovative technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible in ML.

My programming journey began with traditional software development, building command-line interfaces and full-stack web applications. However, as I dived deeper into the world of data science, I found my true calling in machine learning. I enjoy nothing more than taking a complex data problem and devising a scalable solution that can make a real-world impact.

In addition to my work in ML, I'm also a Bayesian statistics enthusiast. I believe that statistical methods can help us better understand the world and make more informed decisions. That's why I've spent considerable time studying and applying Bayesian statistics to various domains, with a focus on incorporating prior knowledge into ML models.

When I'm not working on ML projects, you can find me writing on my [personal blog](https://elc.github.io) about programming, data science, and other tech-related topics. I'm also a passionate Christian and an active member of my church community. I love exploring the intersection of my faith and my love for statistics and data science.

Below you will find some stats of the things I do outside of my work

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile, and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or ideas for collaboration.
